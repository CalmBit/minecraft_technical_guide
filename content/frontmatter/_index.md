# Minecraft Technical Guide

Welcome to the Minecraft Technical Guide! This project aims to document, in slightly more intricate detail, some of the more data-driven aspects of pursuits such as Resource Pack creation, mapmaking, and more. The hope is that this document will adapt to later versions and serve as a comprehensive, definitive resource for people looking for an in-depth knowledge of these topics.
